              <h2>My 100 days of code</h2>
              <p>I started this project on January 3th 2019, and my reasoning for this decision is, that it is far
                easier to stay commited to a project if everyone can keep an eye on you.</p>
              <p>My plans for this project, is to learn a lot more about web development, especially using frameworks
                like Vue and React for the front-end, and learn a lot more about back-end, mainly node.js, PHP and if I
                got time, I would also like to get started on Python.</p>
              <p>During this periode I will also be looking for work in web-development and web-design functions. So if
                anybody know about some open positions, please feel free to contact me.</p>

              <h2>100 Days Of Code Project</h2>
              <p>The rules i will try to live up to for the next 100 days:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Code for minimum an hour a day</li>
                <li>Tweet your progress daily with the hashtag: #100DaysOfCode</li>
                <li>Each day, reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge</li>
              </ul>

                <h3>Day off</h3>
                <p>I took a day off coding. I had a bad headache and were really
                  tired, so I thought it would be nice to get a little rest.
                </p>
                <p>But I did not forget about javascript all together, I did watch a video
                  from CJ on the Coding Garden from this weeks stream, where he orders a pizza
                  using javascript.

                <h3>Pomodoro Clock</h3>
                <p>Another project on FreeCodeCamp. This time a clock, that make it
                  easier to remember to take breaks when you are working.
                </p>
                <p>Today I have made the layout and the CSS for the clock. The clock it self
                  will be made in React. I am getting more used to React, and it doesn't seem
                  so difficult now.

              <h3>16 of 16 tests passed</h3>
              <p>Finally I got all the tests passed. I only had to delete everything for the second time, 
                and start the component again, but this time I were successful.
              </p>
              <p>Now I will get some rest and sleep, so I can be ready for another day.</p>

              <p>Had to scratch everything from the last few days, besides for the layout
                and style, to get the calculator to pass the tests on FreeCodeCamp.
              </p>
              <p>So I finally got to try, for real, the usefullness of the Git branch. Have played
                around with it before, but never really used it. But it is really a powerfull took,
                and I will defently use it more in the future.
              </p>
              <p>But never the less I still struggle with the tests, and have to continiue tomorrow.</p>

              <h3>Pulling the rest of my hair out</h3>
              <p>This React is really messing with my brain. What is just straight forward
                in vanilla javascript, is convoluted and difficult in React, or maybe it
                is just me and my brain that aren't wired the right way for coding in React.
              </p>
              <p>It always take me a little time to get in to the thought process. Maybe it is
                because I switch a lot, and not focus on one thing, but I do like to do that,
                and it makes everything more interessting.
              </p>
              <p>And usually I always figure it out in the end. Not the most pretty and straight forward
                methode, but hey, thats just me.

              <h3>FreeCodeCamp</h3>
              <p>A little break from Ruby. I do need to clear my brain, and what better
                way, than to dive in to some javascript? I still need to finish 4 projects
                on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp's</a> 
                Front End Libraries section to "get" my certificate, and as it happends one of
                the projects is a calculator, and I KNOW how to make a calculator in javascript!
              </p>
              <p>One little problem though, you need to use a library for theese projects, and they
                only fully support <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> for the moment,
                so I have to get in to the React way of thinking again.
              </p>
              <p>And that is totally different form how anyhting else work, and it always meke my
                head hurt.
              </p>
              <p>But at least I were able to get the layout, "HTML" (jsx) and CSS to work today,
                everything else have to wait for tomorrow.

              <p>Still on the Ruby, and still confused. I thought it would be easier
                to learn new, but it is quite hard. It is going to take some time to
                feel safe coding Ruby.
              </p>
              <p>Next on the Odin Projects is Rails, but I think I need to be a bit better ar Ruby first.</p>

              <h3>Ruby</h3>
              <p>Dove deeper in to the basic Ruby, with a lot of reading,
                and a lot of coding. But as usual when you learn a new programming
                language, the coding in the beginning are "nonsense" like the usual
                "Hello World", and a basic run down the syntax of the language.
              </p>
              <p>By now I have only programmed in PHP and javascript, and there are a few
                parts og these languages that are a little alike. But Ruby is a totally different 
                language, and it is going to take some time before I am any good at this, but for 
                every language you learn, it is getting easier.

              <p>A lot of javascript and at lot of thinking today. Who knew

              </p>

              <p>Another project from the Odin Project. These projects are inbetween a lot
                of theory, but the projects are more interesting to tell about, and here are a
                something that can be shown off and tried.
              </p>
              <p>This time it is a calculator. I have made one before in Vue, but this time it is in 
                vanilla javascript. Today I have spend my time with the HTML and CSS, so it is only
                for the looks.

              <p>They have a quite large course in webdevelopment. The reason for me to be interested in
                this course, is that they focus on Ruby and Rails, where most other courses are "just" javascript, HTML and CSS.
              </p>
              <p>These elements are also at Odin, but you don't see Ruby in many palaces.</p>
              <p>Most of the day were spend installing the Linus distrobution xubuntu on a virtual machine on my laptop,
                and getting that ready for development. Finally an excuse to look more into Linux.
              </p>
              <p>First part of the course were about Git and Github, so I got a nice refresher course.</p>

              <p>After the login auth and set up of routes to sign-up,
                login, and boards, and the basic set up of the functionality for the boards page,
                and my first real attempt to work with vuetify.
              </p>
              <p>First impression is that it is a lot like every other front-end frame work, 
                and I am not a huge fan of those. But it is quite well integrated in Vue,
                and as I have mentioned before, it is really easy to make a good looking layout really fast.
              </p>
              <p>On the other hand feathers.js are an amazing tool, and it really makes it easy to set up an API.
                It takes all the "routine" setup for an Express server, and a database connection, and you just have to 
                make the models for the db. Not the last time I will use that.
              </p>
              <p>I got set up and styled the boards page, and the single board page.</p>

              <p>Vue seems to have a magnetic effect on me, and I can't seem to stay away.
                Still with my new favorite Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw">
                  the Coding Garden</a>. This time it is a much larger project, building a clone of Trello.

              <p>The front-end is as I said before, a Vue based app, and the styling is done with vuetify material design.</p>
              <p>Today I got to set up authentication with feathers, make mongoose models for the user and boards
                collections in the database. And made the login, sign-up and boards page.

              <p>Used <a href="https://darksky.net/dev" target="_blank">darksky.net</a> for the weather API. Works just great, and it is still quite easy and logical
                to work with Vue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only problem with darksky's API is they don't get the location, just the timezone, so I had to find,
                an API that could help me with that. Here I found <a href="https://opencagedata.com/api" target="_blank">OpenCage.com</a>.
                Very good API, can also get the coordinates from an adress, so I implemented that one too.
              </p>
              <p>Finalluy I added vues geolocation package, so I can get the users current address.</p>
              <p>All in all a great experience and you can see the final product here:</p>

              <h3>More Vue.js</h3>
              <p>I wanted to make some more with Vue.js, so I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWSu4jfim0Q"
                  target="_blank">another tutorial</a> on Coding Gardens
                Youtube channal (link to Coding Garden in post from yesterday). This time a weather app made with Vue
                and bootstrap.
              </p>
              <p>This is absolutly not the first weather app I have made, but it seemed like a lot of fun, and most
                important
                it was with Vue.
              </p>
              <p>And it was a lot of fun. Still have my doubt about Bootstrab, but it is just so easy.</p>
              <p>Well tomorrow I better be a good boy, and get going with the wordpress site again, and wait till next
                weekend to finish the weather app.

              <img src="./images/dag24.jpg">
              <p>I needed a break from Wordpress, so I found a great tutorial on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw">Coding
                  Garden</a>
                youtube channe on building a l<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xIoWm08SBM">fullstack message
                  board</a> with node.js, express, MongoDB, Vue and Bootstrap.
              </p>
              <p>It was really nice to get into javascript again. And I always enjoy to build something in node.js.</p>
              <p>The backend for the app is build with express for the server. Mongo for the database and monk.js and
                Joi.js for the
                connection to the db and for some validation. I normally use Mongoose, but monk is quite easy to work
                with, and I have to use that again.
              </p>
              <p>The frontend i made with Vue.js. Everytime I use Vue I just get more and more happy to use it. It is
                easy
                to make something great, and with the @vue/cli tool, it is up and running in no time.
              </p>
              <p>Bootstrat make a nice looking website really fast work, and it is easy to get a good result fast.
                But I have to say, I do like to make my own CSS, but sometimes it is nice to cheat a bit.

              <p>Messed around with the archive pages, and got a few bugs fixed.</p>

              <p>Another really long day of coding today. Ended up on 13 hours. I have to take it slow,
                for a few days afther this, or I will completly burn out.
              </p>
              <p>But the day have been productive. I worked on the wodget area, added a new one, and got both
                of them styles. I also got some basic styles added for the widgets, not much, but now they look
                like they belong in the theme.
              </p>
              <p>Found a great contact form, that also can work as a widget, so I can get the contact form in the
                sidebar
                on all the pages.
              </p>
              <p>I also got time to work on the archive pages, added some style and got all of them looking good.</p>

              <p>Wordpress is quite tricky today. And I have been considering to make a CMS myself
                in PHP. It have been a while sinse I did that, but that is a big task to start,
                and the client wanted a Wordpress site, so I better have to bite the bullet and keep
                going.
              </p>
              <p>But I do think I will make a CMS in PHP when I am done with this project.</p>

              <p>Got the menu to do what I wanted. ANd now it is also fully responsive, thanks to some
                jQuery "borrowed" from the twentyseventeen theme, but it works, and it is looking ok.
              </p>
              <p>The footer is also done, styled and made responsive. Quite a bit easier than the menu.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow starts the part I am dreadding the most. Create and style the static pages. Still not
                sure how to deal with them, but as always it will be just fine.

              <p>Finished this iteration of the header, and got it fully responsive with some media queries.</p>
              <p>The menu is still making problems, but the lynda tutorial is a great help. Got the menu styled
                to use the theme colors, and used flexbox for the base layout. Now I just need to make it fully
                responsive
                with some javascript and some more SASS.

              <p>Coded and styled the header for the theme, got the logo inserter, and working from
                the Wordpress back-end. Header layout is made with flexbox, and it were quite ease to make
                it look as I wanted.
              </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the menu is costing some problems. It is quite hard to make it do as I want.
                The biggest problem is, that I want to make the back-end work as mormal in Wordpress, eventhough
                the client have no reason to make any changes in the layout, but I feel it would be a lot nicer,
                if everything Wordpress works as intended.

              <h3>Wordpress Theme from Scratch</h3>
              <p>Today I was contacted by a local company, that I have woeked for before, and asked if I
                can turn their website in to a Wordpress site, so they them self can add news, and post photos
                from their production.
              </p>
              <p>I have just briefly worked with Wordpress, and just by crating simple pages, and a child theme.</p>
              <p>So the whole thing in quite new to me, but I took it as a challenge, and started a <a href="https://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-Building-Themes-from-Scratch-Using-Underscores/491704-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3awordpress+theme+from+scratch%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2"

                in building Wordpress themes using the underscore theme.</p>

              <h3>Node API for a todo list</h3>
              <p>First time I ever made a RESTful API in node.js, I have to say,
                I didn't understand much. Maybe the teacher were bad, or I were just to dumb to understand.
              </p>
              <p>But now, after I have made 8 - 10 of them, some in connection with some tutorials, and a couple from
                scratch,
                I have to say the logic is starting to make sense.
              </p>
              <p>Today, working on web-dev bootcamp on Udemy, I made an API, with node.js, mongoDB, mongoose.js and
                express.js, for a todo list. (You have to make one atleast once every 3 months :))</p>
              <p>The front-end is made in HTML, CSS and Jquery. Forst time I have made a whole front-end in JQuery,
                usually I have made it in a framework, and mostly Angular, but it was a nice change.</p>
              <p>My experience in JQuery before this were quite limited, but it is really easy to work with, and I
                think I will try to use it some more.</p>

              <p>And it were the hard parts of javascript on the program for today.</p>
              <p>Closures and the This keyword are hard to understand in theory. And I have to admit that I will have
                to spend more time on the theory. But in use eg in React or Vue, it just flow, and then I think I do
                understand.</p>
              <p>The courses age shows when it comes to the chapter on orient objected programming, where it is about
                prototype and constructor functions,
                and no mention of the ES6 Class part.

              <p>Just done the last few chapters in Wes Bos CSS Grid course, and all I have to say is,
                that if you are working with frontend development in any way, and not are sure how to work
                with the grid, <a href="https://cssgrid.io/" target="_blank">this course</a> is a great intro, and it

              <p>Still impresses me how far CSS have come, just from a few years ago,
                where we fought with floats, and had very big problems to get the layout to be just right.
              </p>
              <p>And I have never been really for css frameworks lige Bootstrao of Foundation, because you add so
                much code that you never uses. But the were/are nice to use when you just want to make a quick
                prototype.

                websites, as a hobby
                since 1998, when you had a really limited way of styling the pages. The first website i made, I had
                frames to split up th sections, and then placed
                the different elements in a table layout. Pure hell.</p>
              <p>Now you can make a layout with a few lines of code, and on top of that, it is responsive from the
                start.</p>

                the Data Visualization Certification, and got to learn about D3.js, a new area of knowledge for me.
              </p>
              <p>Got through the first half of the D3 section.</p>

              <h3>Video and blog page</h3>
              <p>Worked got the most of the styles on on the blog page, and then cheated
                for the rest of the day, just watching videos on Youtube.</p>
              <p>First a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEYgXP04GpI&t=28s" target="_blank">live stream form
                  Paris</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw" target="_blank">The
                  Coding Train Youtube Channel</a>. I have to say that I really
                enjoy to see the live streams on this channel, and I do try to catch them every time.</p>
              <p>Then later CJ had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfcKdxTWo8" target="_blank">a live stream</a>
                on
                the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw" target="_blank">The Coding
                  Garden</a>.</p>
              <p>Also a channel I really like, and both <a href="https://twitter.com/shiffman" target="_blank">Daniel
                  Shiffman</a> and
                CJ are great teachers. i do learn something every time I watch one of thier videos.<p>

              <h3>More SASS</h3>
              <p>Worked some more on this blog page for the project.</p>
              <p>I still find it rewarding to work with the styling of a web page, and SASS just make it more fun.</p>
              <p>And I am still impressed of flexbox and grid. These tools makes the layout so easy to make compared to
                the floats and
                css frameworks that I do not like at all.</p>

              <h3>Javascript Image Carousel</h3>
              <p>Found a great tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw" target="_blank">Kevin
                  Powels youtube channel</a>
                building an Image Carousel in HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript</p>
              <p>Worked through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYsVOamdB0g" target="_blank">part 1, HTML and
                  CSS</a> and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBzsE0oieio&t=804s" target="_blank">part 2, Javascript</a>.</p>
              <p>This is a fun project, and a good way to learn some more javascript.</p>

              <h3>Start</h3>
              <p>To start the project, I thought it would be nice to repeat the great <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sass-tutorials/Sass-Essential-Training/375925-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asass%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2"
                  target="_blank">SASS course</p> on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="blank">lynda.com</a></p>
              <p>Got the base files, including the package.json and the gulpfile.js. A bit easier this time around, but
                still had to look in the <a href="https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start" target="_blank">gulp
                  starter docs</a>.</p>
              <p>To use the SASS for something usefull, I started on this page.</p>
